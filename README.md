How to get GO IDE running with JetBrains & your Mac

1. [Install the Mac OS X package installer](https://golang.org/dl/) Download the package file, open it, and follow the prompts to install the Go tools. The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

2. Set up environment variables

3. Install JetBrains plug-in
